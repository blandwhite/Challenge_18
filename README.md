## Background

We are fintech engineers working at one of the five largest banks in the world. We were recently promoted to act as the lead developer on their decentralized finance team. Our task is to build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

## What is Being Created

A python script `pychain.py` is written using Visual Studio Code, and includes a user-friendly web interface handled by Streamlit. The code will employ blockchain technology to build a ledger that will allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.
